A simple, typography-driven portfolio theme with a bright, cheery color scheme. It is based on _s, which is a great starter theme. http://underscores.me/

This theme was built for Joeleen Kennedy’s personal portfolio site(http://joeleen.net/). You are free to use it, but you will need to update several files to suit your needs.
