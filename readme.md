# joeleenkennedy

A simple, typography-driven portfolio theme with a bright, cheery color scheme. It is based on _s, which is a great starter theme. [http://underscores.me/](http://underscores.me/)

This theme was built for [Joeleen Kennedy's personal portfolio site](http://joeleen.net/). You are free to use it, but you will need to update several files to suit your needs.
